# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics to gain insights on the table.

# Creating the table.
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

# Then I inserted Spotify Data .csv into the table.

# Next, I explored the data to see what I can find.

#1. What is the average danceability by artist?
SELECT artist_name, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#2. What are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#3. What artist released the longest song, and how long was it?
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;
