# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many order were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

#2. How many of those order were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the account numbers for all the order that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON customers.acctnum = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER by price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP by product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(quantity), product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP by product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February and how many of each were sold.
